1 CONC I have been visiting Dad & Sally on a fairly regular basis for a year or t
1 CONC wo now and on each visit I learn something something new about my famili
1 CONC es history. We'll just be chatting at the table or out walking the dogs a
1 CONC nd out will come a gem of information from the past. When Uncle Pibby is a
1 CONC lso up visiting with dad at the same time I usually am able to hear more s
1 CONC tories of their past. That of course is when the two of them aren't misbeh
1 CONC aving with the waitresses when they go for breakfast every morning! It's t
1 CONC rue, their little devils when you put them together. 
1 CONT At 88 years old Dad impressively remembered the street numbers & nam
1 CONC es of all his childhood residences. Dad did state that due to his paren
1 CONC ts divorce he never really had the opportunity to get close to his Follans
1 CONC bee relatives to learn of family history on that side. And his grandparen
1 CONC ts on the Duguid side moved to California when Frank was very young preven
1 CONC ting him from learning his family history on that side either. Life wasn
1 CONC 't easy for his mother, his brother & himself.  Life was more about surviv
1 CONC al and making it day to day and  warm fuzzy stories about ancestors most l
1 CONC ikely didn't take place. But dad did supply me with the information th
1 CONC at he did know of......... 
1 CONT The following is a list of information that Frank could recollect about h
1 CONC is past. 
1 CONT Frank stated that when he was born in the Boston City Hospital the fami
1 CONC ly was living on Humboldt Ave., Roxbury, MA. My fathers earliest memory w
1 CONC as after his father left the family they moved to 222 W. Newton St., Bosto
1 CONC n. He remembered the home being beside train tracks. They  lived at this a
1 CONC ddress for quite a while. Being a very poor family the local Congregation
1 CONC al Church regularly sent the family food baskets. They also sent Fra
1 CONC nk to a camp at Lake Winnisquam in NH every summer and my Uncle Ernest (Pi
1 CONC bby) went once that my fathers remembers. This is when Frank realized th
1 CONC at there was life beyond the city, a great outdoors with mountains and lak
1 CONC es, great blue skies. Frank wanted this life and made it a goal to stri
1 CONC ve for. Later in life it would slowly become a reality. He is now surround
1 CONC ed by ocean, coves, seagulls, a rocky coastline, fishing village, his dre
1 CONC am come true. 
1 CONT When the family lived on 294 Columbus Ave. there was a new playground bui
1 CONC lt on Columbus Ave. when my father was a youngster. There are pictur
1 CONC es of it showing several wooden swings, ladder type seesaws, a large baseb
1 CONC all field. Several children taking advantage of all the new equipment a
1 CONC nd having great fun. I can only imagine Frank and Ernest being one of tho
1 CONC se children on the playground laughing with the other kids. 
1 CONT As a teenager Frank enjoyed being a lightweight boxer. Apparently it earn
1 CONC ed him enough money to supplement the families poverty level income.
1 CONT Living a tough life Frank decided to quit high school to hang out with fri
1 CONC ends. After a while he realized what a mistake he had made and return
1 CONC ed to school. He lost an entire year and graduated a year after his classm
1 CONC ates. He did have a talent for art as I remember as a child going into o
1 CONC ur attic and there was a box of art drawings that dad had done that ev
1 CONC en at a very young age I knew they good and surprised that dad never to
1 CONC ld us about this talent. 
1 CONT Frank mentioned two of his close childhood buddies that he could remembe
1 CONC r, Fred Jefferie and Fred Stewart. He said he and Fred Stewart use to g
1 CONC et into trouble on a regular basis. He chuckled when he said 'Freddie ma
1 CONC de me do it!' 
1 CONT Frank entered the military 24 May 1943. Army S.N. 0-681370. He train
1 CONC ed to fly B17G bomber planes at the Reeses Air Base in Lubbock, Texa
1 CONC s. He graduated from Flying School in Class 43A on May 23, 1943.  1st L
1 CONC t. Squadron T 327th Army Air Force Base Unit, Drew Field, Florida. His ho
1 CONC me address when enlisted was 294 Columbus Ave, Boston, Ma. Military occupa
1 CONC tion- Pilot Four Engine 1091. Battles and Campaigns; Rome Arno Air Offensi
1 CONC ve Europe So. France GO 105 WD 45. 
1 CONT On March 30, 1944, the plane that dad was flying in during an engineeri
1 CONC ng test flight had a landing accident. It was found to be pilots carelessn
1 CONC ess. Apparently, while preparing to land they realized that the landing ge
1 CONC ar in the rear had not released. The pilot sent a man to the back to inspe
1 CONC ct the problem. The man failed to return, due to making an attempt to manu
1 CONC ally lowering the landing gear. The pilot decided to land the plane and th
1 CONC us damaging the tail end of the plane.   
1 CONT Decorations and Citations; European African Middle Eastern Service Meda
1 CONC l, WWII Victory Medal, Air Medal with 3 OLC GO961 HQ 15 AF, June 1944; Dis
1 CONC tinguished Flying Cross GO 2487 HQ 15 AF August 1944.
1 CONT Date of relief from active duty: 2 June 1946. Rank upon relief: 2nd Lt.. H
1 CONC ome address upon relief: 11 Simpson Ave., Somerville, Ma. (He, Mary and Ma
1 CONC rtina moved in with Mary's parents temporarily). Later the family mov
1 CONC ed to Norwell St., Dorchester, MA where Cheryl and Frankie were born. The
1 CONC ir apartment was above 'Pops' variety store. and beside train tracks. S
1 CONC t. Leo's Church where Cheryl & Frankie were baptized was down the street f
1 CONC rom the apartment.  
1 CONT Some of Franks service buddies; 
1 CONT Bob W. Fortnam b. 10/25/1922  in England. Lived in Roxbury, Ma. Father w
1 CONC as a plumber. In December 2006 I was able to locate Bob Fortnam in Pembrok
1 CONC e, NH and he is still flying! How wonderfully amazing! He sounded very chi
1 CONC pper and spry. We spoke on the phone for awhile. He told me about his ti
1 CONC me that he & dad spent together in Air Force Training School and were sepa
1 CONC rated after that. Now about 60 years later we are planning a reunion for t
1 CONC hem. Bob does go around to local organizations and shares his military sto
1 CONC ries with others. He was a Prisoner of War and said he appreciates being a
1 CONC ble to teach others about what that experience was like. I commented to h
1 CONC im if it didn't bother him to keep reliving that time in his life. He sa
1 CONC id talking about being a prisoner doesn't bother him. What does bother h
1 CONC im a great deal are the people who go around saying that the Holocaust did
1 CONC n't happen. It did happen & I will keep that message going.  I am anxio
1 CONC us to hear his side of the story. I have never been blessed to be in the p
1 CONC resence of a WWII P.O.W. survivor and to hear their very own experience
1 CONC s. It is impossible to imagine what that must have like to live it everyda
1 CONC y. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Russ Gardner b. 11/11/1921; Bob Fortnam did mention that he sees Russ on
1 CONC ce or twice a year for a reunion and will happy to inform him that he h
1 CONC as made contact with Franks family. I am hopeful to make it a 3 way reunio
1 CONC n. 
1 CONT I have not been able to locate these other friends of dads from his past:
1 CONT Bruce F. Fox
1 CONT Jack Frazer
1 CONT Bill Hall
1 CONT
1 CONT Frank married Mary while he was still in the service. He brought her do
1 CONC wn to the base he was on at Davis-Monthan Airfield, Tucson, Arizona to mar
1 CONC ry. Then they moved to Tampa, Florida when Frank was transferred to Drew F
1 CONC ield Base. Martina was his only child born in Tampa and outside of the Bos
1 CONC ton area. 
1 CONT __________________________________________________________________________
1 CONC ___________________
1 CONT
1 CONT During yet another visit to dad's he told me of a story about getting in
1 CONC to trouble as a teenager:
1 CONT Dad's friend, Fred Stewart, lived on West Springfield St., Boston, a
1 CONC nd he had been in the service. One time when he was on leave he went looki
1 CONC ng for Frank and found him working parking cars at a busy restaurant, Walt
1 CONC on's Lunch, Kenmore Square, Boston. Fred had a bottle of wine with him a
1 CONC nd they got a bit tipsy right there in the parking lot. Then they thoug
1 CONC ht it would be fun if they 'borrowed' one of the cars and went for a joy r
1 CONC ide. It was fun until they got into an accident and cracked up the c
1 CONC ar in Dedham, MA. Dad had to get stitches on his tongue and he got 1 ye
1 CONC ar on probation. 
1 CONT Dad also told me how he sold newspapers on the street corner of Columbus A
1 CONC ve & Claredon St. during the winter & his fingers would freeze while tryi
1 CONC ng to hussle the newspapers.

1 CONT The following notes are the memories of Marion's son, Frank, at 84 y.o. a
1 CONC nd my own from childhood.
1 CONT Marions parents met and married in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. They ca
1 CONC me to U.S. to live and raise their family. To my fathers recollection th
1 CONC ey had 3 daughters; Angie aka Annie, Violet, and Marion and a son, Wallac
1 CONC e. When the children were older the family with the exception of Marion a
1 CONC nd Violet moved to California. Violet and Marion were both married at th
1 CONC is time and had families of their own so they stayed in Boston. See ent
1 CONC ry for 'Violet'. 
1 CONT When Marion and Ernest were first married they lived on Humboldt Ave. in R
1 CONC oxbury,Ma. Ernest worked at the Hathaway Bakeries, Inc. on Richdale Ave, C
1 CONC ambridge,Ma. This is where he met book keeper, Ethel Mckee. In 1927 Erne
1 CONC st left his pregnant wife and his 10 y.o. son, Frank and moved to 4 Cogswe
1 CONC ll Ave.,Cambridge, Ma. Soon after, he divorced Marion and married Ethel. 
1 CONT Alone with Frank and with child, Marion moved to 222 W.Newton St., Boston,
1 CONC Ma located beside train tracks. The Congregational Church on the corn
1 CONC er of W. Newton St. and Columbus Ave. would regularly send the family bask
1 CONC ets of food. Frank fondly remembers how the Church sent him on numerous su
1 CONC mmers to camp on Lake Winnisqwam in NH. This is where Frank fell in love w
1 CONC ith the outdoors and was determined to move out of Boston when he grew u
1 CONC p. The family of 3 also lived at 72 Appleton St. and then 294 Columbus Ave
1 CONC ., Boston, MA. At 294 Columbus Ave. they lived above a tire company whi
1 CONC ch caught fire during the winter. This sent the family to yet another addr
1 CONC ess. Dad remembered in those early days ice was frequently in the toilet d
1 CONC uring the winter. And when he and his brother would have to go down to t
1 CONC he basement for coal they would always have to 'scoot' rats out of the w
1 CONC ay while making their way to the coal bin.
1 CONT According to Frank his brother, Ernest, 10 years his junior, also we
1 CONC nt to this camp once or twice. 
1 CONT Frank also recalled a gentleman by the name of 'Crowell' visited the fami
1 CONC ly regularly after his father left them ( I believe this would have been h
1 CONC is Great Grandfather). Frank remembers this man as being a nice English ma
1 CONC n. He would come around to check up on how the family was faring. 
1 CONT Marion and her sister Violet would get together on a regular basis with t
1 CONC he children for family visits. Frank remembered these as good times.  
1 CONT
1 CONT Auntie-Auntie, as we grandchildren fondly called her (as she never want
1 CONC ed to be considered a 'grandmother'), was a tall, sweet and reclusive lad
1 CONC y. Our family got to spend time with her when Dad would drive into Bost
1 CONC on on holidays and special occasions to pick Auntie-Auntie up and bring h
1 CONC er to our home. My younger brother, Frankie, and I would often accompany D
1 CONC ad on these trips into Boston. She lived in an apartment on Claredon St
1 CONC ., Boston, Ma for as long as I could remember. All the apartment buildin
1 CONC gs on this street were 'brownstones' - old, brick building, narrow and ta
1 CONC ll of four or more stories & nestled close together. The stairwell up to h
1 CONC er apartment was gloomy. paint peeling exposing plaster underneath. I dou
1 CONC bt much repair had been done to these apartments during this time. There w
1 CONC ere single bare light bulbs hanging from the ceiling on each landing. We h
1 CONC ad to climb at least four flights to her apartment. Inside there were t
1 CONC wo bedrooms ( the inside of either I  never saw); a large front living roo
1 CONC m; a bathroom; and a kitchen. Years before my memory can serve me Auntie-A
1 CONC untie resigned herself to living out her life in the kitchen, choosi
1 CONC ng to forget the other rooms existed. This could have been an issue with h
1 CONC eat & living on a fixed income. We would enter the apartment,a right wou
1 CONC ld take you to the living room, turn left and pass the bathroom on the rig
1 CONC ht, bedrooms to the left and walk straight to the kitchen at the end of t
1 CONC he short hallway. It was a small rectangle room that was home to her a
1 CONC nd a large black cast iron stove; an old, well worn sofa; a kitchen tabl
1 CONC e; and Dads military pictures sitting on another smaller table. I vague
1 CONC ly remember shelves with food goods on them. The entire apartment had t
1 CONC he same gloominess as the stairwell. I doubt that the living room so
1 CONC fa or chairs had been sat in since her sons left to marry. Fixtures in t
1 CONC he bathroom worked well despite their age. The 'water closet' was a high l
1 CONC evel cistern dated approximately 1890. I don't clearly remember the detai
1 CONC ls of the sink or tub except that they were old. We would always find Aunt
1 CONC ie-Auntie sitting on the sofa in a calf length cotton dress and a tie on p
1 CONC lastic apron with black lace up shoes. She wore a dark brown wig of medi
1 CONC um length after losing much of her frontal hair caused by a fire in a wood
1 CONC /coal stove.
1 CONT My father relayed a short story that he, my mother, sister Martina and pos
1 CONC sibly sister Patricia lived in this apartment for a short time while Aunti
1 CONC e-Auntie lived on Columbus Ave.
1 CONT  Auntie-Auntie was soft spoken, sweet, good company for all of us. We a
1 CONC ll would take turns spending time with her. I remember when Auntie-Aunt
1 CONC ie would visit us, she would be having coffee and Mom having tea at the ki
1 CONC tchen table talking for long lengths of time and chuckling about each othe
1 CONC rs stories. Since both ladies were loners this must have been a good ti
1 CONC me for both of them to get together. 
1 CONT Auntie-Auntie developed senior diabetes. Over the course of time in her se
1 CONC venties her condition worsened. After an operation to remove her toes on o
1 CONC ne foot she was admitted to a nursing home in West Roxbury, Boston, MA. H
1 CONC er condition did not improve and before long her leg had to be removed a
1 CONC nd then it started on the other leg. From what I can remember she ga
1 CONC ve up on life at this point and passed away, January 31, 1973.

1 CONT The Name Walsh:
1 CONT The Walsh family, of Welsh origin, were established in Kilkenny, among ma
1 CONC ny other places in Ireland by the 13th century. 
1 CONT Walsh is one of the most common Irish names. Unlike most Irish name
1 CONC s, it is found in every county in Ireland. It is a corruption of the wo
1 CONC rd "Welsh." The people first given the name were part in the Anglo-Norm
1 CONC an invasion of Ireland in the early 1100s. The Normans had just conquer
1 CONC ed England and were trying to conquer Ireland. Since they came through Wal
1 CONC es the native Irish called them Welsh. In fact, they were from Norman
1 CONC dy in northern France. Most people named Welsh are part of the same gro
1 CONC up and in parts of Ireland today Walsh is pronounced Welsh. The Normans es
1 CONC tablished a number of coastal cities and had areas of influence into the s
1 CONC urrounding areas. Soon they became "more Irish than the Irish themselves
1 CONC ," abandoning their French language for Irish and most of their French wa
1 CONC ys for Irish customs. They also were very independent of Normans elsewhe
1 CONC re and often fought later British attempts to conquer Ireland. By 1640 wh
1 CONC en Oliver Cromwell finally conquered all of Ireland, they had been complet
1 CONC ely absorbed into the Irish population.

1 CONT According to Samuels obituary:  
1 CONT In Samuels boyhood, while attending school, he worked in a ship carpente

1 CONC st of the time he spent in West Newbury until 1851 when he moved his fami

1 CONT In America, the comb industry centered around W. Newbury and later on in L
1 CONC eominster,Mass.  Enoch Noyes established a comb making comp. in 1759 in t
1 CONC he sub-cellar of his home at the corner of Crane Neck and Main stree
1 CONC ts in W. Newbury.  He is known for contriving many inventions. His com
1 CONC bs of wood and horn were simple, primitive objects until a stranger, so t
1 CONC he story goes, appeared at his door in 1778 asking for employment. This m
1 CONC an was William Cleland, a German Hessian deserted from Burgoynes army aft
1 CONC er being captured by Gen'l Stark and placed at Major Little's farm. Willi
1 CONC am was a comb maker by profession, and a skillful workman. He brought wi
1 CONC th him old country skills and special tools for making combs. This was t
1 CONC he commencement of the comb-making business in Newbury. The cattle horns w
1 CONC ould arrive in barrels and had to soak for months to soften them up. The i
1 CONC nsides had to be scraped cleaned and the softened horn would be cut and fl
1 CONC attened by heated iron plates. The odor of the soaking horns in barrels f
1 CONC or months was putrid. There are other procedures for preparing the horns b
1 CONC ut this was the most popular. Combs would be cut to size, and when the tee
1 CONC th on the combs were complete they had to be hand filed like a toothpic
1 CONC k. The combs produced after Williams joining Mr. Noyes were much finer a
1 CONC nd more finished products.  They became so successful that by 1793 there w
1 CONC ere 70 horn smiths working in the area making combs. Years later Enoch al
1 CONC so had a comb manufacturing business in Newburyport which eventually his s
1 CONC on and grandson took over. Obadiah Hills learned the trade of  making com
1 CONC bs by hand in W. Newbury. He took his trade and moved to Leominster, Ma. s
1 CONC tarting a comb making business. The industry was even more successful in L
1 CONC eominster than in W. Newbury as there was an abundance of raw supplies. Th
1 CONC is growth in combs stimulated a decade of rapid population increase in Leo
1 CONC minster. But as the local, national, and worldwide demand for combs mushro
1 CONC omed, supplies of horn, tortoise shell, and ivory became increasingly hard
1 CONC er to obtain  The horn made comb industry slowly died out around 1900's wi
1 CONC th the invention of celluloid (a plastic) around 1870 .

1 CONC ed Portsmouth church and schoolhouse. In 1671 he had moved from Great Is
1 CONC l, and hired the Abraham Corbett house near the meetinghouse , when Mr. He
1 CONC nry Dering, also removing to Strawberry Bank, hired the same house und
1 CONC er a better title, whereupon the sheriffs turned Thomas out without noti
1 CONC ce in the depth of winter with no habitation provided for 'his wife and ma
1 CONC ny smale children. On another record, In 1673 his wife Mary +/-34, ab. mid
1 CONC night hearing Rachel Webster cry murder, rose up and went to the window a
1 CONC nd asked said Webster why out of her house at that time of night, end of r

1 CONC Genealogies.
1 CONT CHASE FAMILY.
1 CONT Prepared by Joshua Coffin, M.A.
1 CONT
1 CONT   Among the early settlers of New England, were three persons by the na
1 CONC me of Chase; namely, William, Thomas, and Aquila. The first (William) sett
1 CONC led in Yarmouth, and there died, in 1659, leaving two sons, Benjamin and W
1 CONC illiam. The last two were certainly brothers, as appears from a deed giv
1 CONC en in 1667 by Aquila to "the sons of his brother Thomas". The name is fou
1 CONC nd in various places in English history, from the time of William the Conq
1 CONC ueror to the present time. Thus, we find in 1326 a family of that na
1 CONC me in Suffolk; a Thomas Chase, who was barbarously murdered in 1506; a S
1 CONC ir Robert Chase, Knight, in the West of England, 1628; a Sir John Cha
1 CONC se  in Exeter, prior to 1637; a John Chase, Esq., Apothecary to Queen Ann
1 CONC e, 1690, &c. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Thomas and Aquila Chase were among the first settlers of Hampton, NH in 16
1 CONC 39.

1 CONT Nathaniel Gould shows in the 1830 and 1840 Census in Newfane, VT.
1 CONT Esther Follansbee Taylor's notes list William, Charles, Lizzie, and Jo
1 CONC hn as siblings.
1 CONT In the Census, there are 30 Goulds in Windham County, including some nam
1 CONC es similar to the listed siblings.
1 CONT On ebay I found a Directory of Newfane, Vt. date ?, I wrote to the sell
1 CONC er to see if any Gould's were listed in it. Here is the reply: The Newfa
1 CONC ne directory lists two Goulds- Charles E. and John. They both lived o
1 CONC ff of Road 15. Not much is described about them-only that Charles was t
1 CONC he son of John. John had a maple orchard with 400 trees and a farm wi
1 CONC th 77 acres. Because I forgot to write down the date I am unable to fit th
1 CONC is into anyone's life. If I remember correctly it may have been in the la
1 CONC te 1880's. CH
1 CONT
1 CONT There use to be Gould's Mills in Springfield, Windsor Co., VT I haven't be
1 CONC en able to find out if they are connected to our Gould's yet. Also the Gou
1 CONC ld's Mills Bridge, same town. 
1 CONT In 1774 Gould’s Mill and a sawmill opened for
1 CONT business, and a settlement sprung up, including a school and
1 CONT several houses. Nearby, Paddock Bridge is one of only two
1 CONT surviving Baltimore Truss bridges in Vermont.

1 CONT In the late 1800s, Springfield needed a railway in order for the
1 CONT town to grow.Across the River, tracks of the Sullivan County
1 CONT Railroad were already laid north as far as White River Junction.
1 CONT Establishing a rail connection from Springfield became such a priority
1 CONT that in 1896 the Town created the Springfield
1 CONT Electric Railway Company, and gave municipal funds to support
1 CONT building a 4-mile link to Charlestown. The power house
1 CONT and dam at Gould’s Mills supplied the power to run the railway.

1 CONC NEHG Register, Vol. 149: William Noyes Rev. Born, 1568. Died, before the 3
1 CONC 0th of April 1622, in Cholderton, Wilts, England (near the edge of Hant
1 CONC s, between Amesbury in the west and Andover in Hampshire). William Noye
1 CONC s, plebian, was matriculated, age 20, at University College, Oxford, 15 N
1 CONC ov 1588, being admitted to the B.A. degree 31 May 1592. He was institut
1 CONC ed rector of Cholderton in 1601, according to the Salisbury "Diocesan Regi
1 CONC ster". 
1 CONT Rev. Cotton Mather, pastor of the North Church in Boston, provides an ins
1 CONC ight into the character of William Noyes while describing, from a contempo
1 CONC rary viewpoint, the early education of Ann's nephew, Rev. Thomas Parker. 
1 CONC "This Mr. Thomas Parker was the only son of his father, who was very desir
1 CONC ous to have him a scholar, committed him unto perhaps a godly, but a ve
1 CONC ry severe master [Rev. William Noyes]. Under this hard master, though he w
1 CONC as well nigh discouraged by the dulness which he apprehended in his own ca
1 CONC pacity, yet the consideration of his father's desire made him, with an ear
1 CONC ly piety, to join his prayers unto his pains, that he might have his educa
1 CONC tion prospered; and God so prospered him, that he arrived unto a desirab
1 CONC le degree of knowledge, both in tongues and in arts." [Magnalia Christi Am
1 CONC ericana (Hartford, 1855), 1:480-488]. 
1 CONT William's grandson, Rev. Nicholas Noyes, of Salem, Massachusetts, told Re
1 CONC v. Cotton Mather that his grandfather was "a very learned man", whose wi
1 CONC fe was a sister of the learned Mr. Robert Parker. 
1 CONT The register of the Diocese shows that he officiated in the Parish from 1
1 CONC 602 to 1620, at which time he resigned. He was then appointed Attorney Gen
1 CONC eral to the King. In 1621, he was succeeded as rector by his son Nathan. D
1 CONC espite his scholarly ways, either Rev. William Noyes failed to keep a pari
1 CONC sh register for Cholderton, or the book has been lost. When Mr. Samuel Hes
1 CONC kins became rector in 1651, he felt it necessary to begin a new book and r
1 CONC ecorded somewhat erroneous information concerning William and his son Nath
1 CONC an. In the NEHG Register, Vol. 42, Oct 1888, p.403 Edward Deering Noyes re
1 CONC ceived a letter from the current Rector of Cholderton, Rev. Edwin P. Barr
1 CONC ow in which is the following extract from the Registry Book: "Mr. Willi
1 CONC am Noyes Rector of Choldington about 30 years departed this life anno 161
1 CONC 6. Mr. Nathan Noyes succeeded his father in the Rectorie of Choldrington a
1 CONC nd departed this life in ye year 1651." Among the burials extracted from t
1 CONC he register is "Mrs. Ann Noyes, widow & Relict of Mr. William Noyes someti
1 CONC me Rector of Choldrington, March 7, 1657, age 82. The present parish regis
1 CONC ter was begun only in 1651, but a complete list of the incumbents from 12
1 CONC 97 is preserved in the Salisbury Diocesan Register. The following recor
1 CONC ds are taken from the "Parish Notes," published in 1889 by Rev. Edwin P. B
1 CONC arrow, the then rector. 
1 CONT "The Church of St. Nicholas, Cheldreton, was given to the Monks of St. Ne
1 CONC ots (Huntingdonshire) about 1175 by Roger Burnard, and the grant was confi
1 CONC rmed by Pope Alexander III. In 1380, 1399 and 1401 John Skylling, lo
1 CONC rd of the manor, was also patron of the church, probably by temporary gran
1 CONC ts from the Convent. In 1445 it was again in St. Neots' Priory, but see
1 CONC ms to have been finally alienated to John Skylling about 1449." Through se
1 CONC veral patrons it came to Sir Thomas Lovell, lord of the manor, in 1492 a
1 CONC nd 1494. John Thornborough was patron in 1567, and by him and Giles Hutchi
1 CONC ns the living was given to William Noyes. Rev. William Noyes became rect
1 CONC or just before the death of Queen Elizabeth and held the living until h
1 CONC is death. In 1840, the old church was pulled down 
1 CONT Cholderton is a small town on the Bourne, about eleven miles from Salisbu
1 CONC ry, which contains the great Salisbury Cathedral, built in the year 1220 A
1 CONC .D., whose lofty tower overlooks the dead Roman city of Sarum and "Stonehe
1 CONC nge." the ruins of the wonderful pre-historic temple of the ancient Celt
1 CONC ic Druids, in the midst of the Salisbury Plain. Nearby is Wilton House, t
1 CONC he seat of the Earl of Pembroke. It is sometimes called West Cholderto
1 CONC n, to distinguish it from Cholderton, Hampshire, which is known as East Ch
1 CONC olderton. 
1 CONT He married Ann Parker, who was a sister of Rev. Robert Parker, a learn
1 CONC ed Puritan divine, and a graduate of Oxford, who was driven to Holland f
1 CONC or "non-conformity" to Queen Elizabeth's forms. 
1 CONT He died intestate before 30 April 1622, when an inventory of his estate w
1 CONC as made. 28 May 1622, his widow Anne was appointed administratrix (Cou
1 CONC rt of Archdeacon of Sarum).

1 CONT The total was an extremely modest £3, 2 shillings, 8 pence. We may assu

1 CONT James Frazier, in 1847, was rector of Cholderton, and in 1870 Bishop of C
1 CONC hester in 1884, and Bishop of Oxford, in 1888. The advowson of the recto
1 CONC ry of Cholderton now belongs to the Provost and Fellows of Oriel Colleg
1 CONC e, Oxford, having come into their possession in 1698. 
1 CONT His brother, Richard Noyes, of Cholderton, yeoman, made his will 25 Aug 1
1 CONC 639, in which he mentions widow Sara. Another brother, Robert Noyes, yeoma
1 CONC n, born in 1570, died 20 Jan 1659, and was buried at Cholderton. The wi
1 CONC ll of Richard Noyes of Manningford Bruce, in the diocese of Sarum, 2 Feb 1
1 CONC 590, mentions "the sons of Robert Noyes of Cholderton." This Robert may ha
1 CONC ve been the father of William, Richard, and Robert Noyes. Richard Noy
1 CONC es of Manningford Bruce was son of William Noyes of Urchfont, yeoman (wi
1 CONC ll 1557), who purchased the prebend of Urchfont in 1540, from the Ea
1 CONC rl of Hertford, afterwards Protector Somerset. The Noyes family of Urchfo

1 CONT In the autumn of 1863 we find Mr. Parrott once more in the office of Lus
1 CONC e, Lane & Co. (this time in the position of foreman), then the largest j
1 CONC ob printing and publishing house in the State. He remained in that situati
1 CONC on until 1869, perfecting himself in book-work, and giving unqualified sat
1 CONC isfaction. In February of the year just mentioned, in company with <b>J.
1 CONC J. Smart</b>, he purchased the office of the <i>Iowa State Reporter</i
1 CONC >, at Waterloo, Black Hawk County, a paper originated as Democratic orga
1 CONC n, and which had died of the political measles at the end of about eight m
1 CONC onths. Two months later the <i>Reporter</i> was revived as a Republican pa
1 CONC per, a bindery was added in June, and the business of manufacturing bla
1 CONC nk books for counties actively commenced. The prospects were good at the s
1 CONC tart; business has grown rapidly, and hardly a county in the northern ha
1 CONC lf of the State but has books with the imprint of their house on them. The
1 CONC ir work is honestly and substantially done, and gives the best satisfactio
1 CONC n. The <i>Reporter</i>, too, has thrived. It has increased in size and bea
1 CONC uty as well as circulation, and is a credit to the newspaper press of Iow
1 CONC a, which is noted for its many first-class journals. In 1872 James L. Girt
1 CONC on became a member of the firm, and the name was changed to <b>Smart</b
1 CONC >, Parrott & Co. In January, 1876, Mr. <b>Smart</b> retired, and J.P. Sher
1 CONC man took an interest and the firm name was changed to Parrott, Girton & Sh
1 CONC erman.

1 CONC 'Comb Industry In Newburyport' 
1 CONT
1 CONT Enoch Noyes in 1759 "commenced, without instruction, making horn button
1 CONC s, and coarse combs, of various kinds." Noyes was soon to acquire a reputa
1 CONC tion as a "rabid Tory" that still lingers in his family; this political di
1 CONC sposition perhaps made it easier for him to enter into a curious partnersh
1 CONC ip that put new life into his business and helped establish West Newbu
1 CONC ry as a major comb making center. 
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT One day in 1778, as Enoch Noyes sat working horn into combs with his ha
1 CONC nd tools, he was approached by a stranger, whose Anglicized name comes do
1 CONC wn to us as William Clelland, or Cleland. Clelland was a Hessian, one of t
1 CONC he German mercenaries from the province of Hesse employed by the Cro
1 CONC wn to bolster regular British forces in the Revolution. According to Josh
1 CONC ua Coffin, he was a deserter from Burgoyne's army, although later accoun
1 CONC ts refer to him as one of a group of prisoners taken either at Benningt
1 CONC on or Saratoga, billeted in or near West Newbury, and given freedom to co
1 CONC me and go as they pleased according to the informal practice of that pla
1 CONC ce and time. 
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT Clelland had been a comb maker in Germany, and in keeping with another pra
1 CONC ctice of the era, he had come to New England with his tools. These were mo
1 CONC re advanced than those used by Enoch Noyes, and when the Hessian propos
1 CONC ed that the two men work together, it must have struck the Yankee as an op
1 CONC portunity not only to increase production but also to learn what a mode
1 CONC rn manufacturer would call the "state of the art." Whatever advantages Cle
1 CONC lland's European tools may have offered, it should be remembered that at t
1 CONC his stage of the industry's development all phases of the comb making oper
1 CONC ation were accomplished by hand, from softening of the horn or tortoise sh
1 CONC ell in hot oil, to cutting and sawing teeth, to smoothing and polishing. 
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT Because technology had not yet made comb making a capital-intensive enterp
1 CONC rise requiring consolidation within larger factories (horse, water, and ev
1 CONC entually steam power would be brought into use), the industry in the We
1 CONC st Newbury of Enoch Noyes' day was still dispersed among a score or mo
1 CONC re of farmhouses. 
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT Although there is no reliable information as to what eventually beca
1 CONC me of William Clelland, the name of Noyes remained prominent in the comb i
1 CONC ndustry from the time of Enoch until well into the twentieth century. 
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT 'Reminiscences of A Nonagenarian' 
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT Mr. Noyes, while a genius, was a great oddity. He would run half over t
1 CONC he parish bareheaded and barefooted. It was no uncommon thing for him to a
1 CONC ppear at our house after dinner on a hot summer day, in only a shirt and b
1 CONC reeches, having run across the fields two miles, "jest to take a nooning
1 CONC ." A great joker and a capital story-teller, his appearance was the sign
1 CONC al for a general frolic. He was more fond of telling strangers that his fa
1 CONC ther used to say he had "four remarkable children: Molly was remarkably ha
1 CONC ndsome, Tim was remarkably sloven, John was remarkably wicked, and Enoch w
1 CONC as remarkably cunning." 
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT 'A County In Revolution' 
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT "If Loyalists had opted for the popular side, life would have been so mu
1 CONC ch easier. Of all the county Loyalists, possibly Enoch Noyes of Newbury, N
1 CONC ew Town was the most indiviualistic and colorful. The lanky, long-haired u
1 CONC nkempt Noyes often was seen running barefoot, sometimes with a hatch
1 CONC et in hand. If Noyes were to be startled the cause of the disturbance cou
1 CONC ld be the likely target of his hatchet. He had other peculiarities. On o
1 CONC ne instance, Noyes was seen armed with a crossbow shooting robins out of h
1 CONC is cherry trees. On another occasion, it was reported that an unsuspecti
1 CONC ng acquaintance greeted Noyes with a loud "How do you do?" Noyes swu
1 CONC ng at his addressor and knocked him to the ground. While some considered N
1 CONC oyes erratic and strange, others saw a genius in him. An avid reader, Noy
1 CONC es could boast the largest library in town. He was among the first in t
1 CONC he vicinity to raise fish and to import fruit trees. Free-thinker Noyes d
1 CONC id not care what people thought of him or his political opinions. But he o
1 CONC ccasionally voiced his Tory views too loudly and had to retreat from popul
1 CONC ar threats against his safety. Noyes built a sub-cellar with an entrance f
1 CONC rom the chimney where he hid for long periods of time. Each day his wife w
1 CONC ould lower his food in a basket tied to a rope. Later in the War, Major Mo
1 CONC ses LIttle returned to his Turkey Hill Farm with 10 Hessian prisoners capt
1 CONC ured from Burgoyne's army at the Battle of Bennington. One of these prison
1 CONC ers was William Cleland. One day Cleland appeared with a knapsack of too
1 CONC ls at the door of Enoch Noyes and offered his services as a skilled comb-m
1 CONC aker. For nearly 20 years, Noyes had been making combs from horn and selli
1 CONC ng them in the Parish. Now he could apply the techniques of European manuf
1 CONC acture. From this humble beginning, New Town became the birthplace of a th
1 CONC riving comb industry in the 19th century."

1 CONT There is controversy on who John's father was. The following informati
1 CONC on is provided by David Carey: Matawadave@@aol.com
1 CONT "The parents of John Cary, the Plymouth Pilgrim, have yet to be positively
1 CONT identified. Most theories have been disproved. He was not the son of John
1 CONT Cary and Elizabeth Hereford. Their son John was married in 1613 (when the
1 CONT Pilgrim was about 3 years old) and died in Hackney , Middlesex, England,
1 CONT before 1665. Proof is found in the pedigree submitted by their grandson Jo
1 CONC hn
1 CONT Cary, the famous London and Virginia merchant, to the Earl Marshall of
1 CONT England which resulted in confirmation of his right to bear the arms of th
1 CONC e
1 CONT noble Carys of Devon (ref. College of Arms, Book of Grants IV) Copies of
1 CONT those documents are filed in the British Library (Stowe MS 670, folio 229)
1 CONT and in the Society of Genealogists Library, London.
1 CONT
1 CONT John the Pilgrim was not the son of Elizabeth and William Cary who was
1 CONT mayor of Bristol in 1621. That theory was proposed by Henry Grosvenor Cary
1 CONT in his The Cary Family in America and is disproved by the Heralds College
1 CONT pedigree of the Bristol Carys. The son of Elizabeth and William Cary was t
1 CONC he
1 CONT John Cary who married Elizabeth Hereford (see above).
1 CONT
1 CONT The theory that John the Pilgrim was the son of Walter Cary and Grace
1 CONT Browne has not been disproved or proved positively. The theory that John t
1 CONC he Pilgrim was the son of Walter Cary and Grace Browne has not been dispro
1 CONC ved or proved positively. Walter died in 1633, about the time the Pilgr
1 CONC im came to Plymouth after a dispute over his father's will leaving his ent
1 CONC ire estate to his wife Grace in order to "tie and bind them [his childre
1 CONC n] the more to be loving and dutiful to their tender and careful mother
1 CONC ". John Cary was an adult in 1633 and came to Plymouth the next year. Grac
1 CONC e's will in 1668 leaves her son John, "if living" a shilling. That sugges
1 CONC ts that she and her son John were estranged. These circumstances roughly p
1 CONC arallel the family tradition that John Cary came to Plymouth in 1834 follo
1 CONC wing a dispute over his father's estate.

1 CONC ed one hundred years, four months, six days. It may be proper to say th
1 CONC at this venerable woman, in explaining why South street formerly went by t
1 CONC he name of Licking Water, used to relate the following: A man once cross
1 CONC ed Mill river on a board, shouting at the top of his voice, "Licking Wate

1 CONT RICHARD PETTINGELL
1 CONT MASSACHUSETTS
1 CONT (1610/11-1695) 
1 CONT
1 CONT Investigation in 1986 by a professional genealogist in England showed th
1 CONC at Richard PETINGALE was baptized in Shotesham All Saints parish, Norfol
1 CONC k, England on 6 Jan 1610/11 to Mathew PETINGALE and his second wife, Ma
1 CONC ry COOKE. Richard was the second son born to Mathew PETINGALE. Richard’s o
1 CONC lder brother, Robert, remained in England, while, Richard decid
1 CONC ed to go to New England. Richard was not in line to inherit his father’s l
1 CONC and as the second son. This was also a period of heavy war taxation, econo
1 CONC mic depression, overpopulation, war with France and Spain and the determin
1 CONC ation of the government to force the Puritans to conform to the Establish
1 CONC ed Church. Passengers that could not pay for their passage became indentur
1 CONC ed servants or apprentices to obtain passage. 
1 CONT
1 CONT According to an article in the journal, Americana, on board the ship, “Lio
1 CONC n’s Whelp” was a passenger listed as Richard PENGIL, arriving in Newbu
1 CONC ry on 29 June 1629. Richard PENGIL is believed to be Richard PETTINGELL al
1 CONC though the Norfolk county emigrations or shipping records are incomplete f
1 CONC or that time period. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Richard was a member of the First Church of Salem in 1637. On June 2, 16
1 CONC 41 he was made a freeman upon the recommendation by his minister, being ov
1 CONC er 20 years of age and worth at least 200 pounds in real or personal prope
1 CONC rty. He had a grant of 10 acres at Enon (Wenham) in 1642 and was a witne
1 CONC ss to the will of Samuel SMITH of Enon in December of that year. He soon m
1 CONC arried Joanna INGERSOLL, (no record found), daughter of Richard INGERSO
1 CONC LL of Salem who named him as one of his sons-in-law in his will of 1644. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Richard was still a member of Salem church when on July 7, 1644, he and h
1 CONC is brother-in-law, John INGERSOLL, were appointed to arrest Sabbath day vi
1 CONC olators. His first child, Samuel, was baptized at Salem on 9 Feb 164
1 CONC 4. He was constable of Wenham in 1648 and in that year he was a witness ag
1 CONC ainst George NORTON for “scandalizing” the church. Matthew, his second chi
1 CONC ld was born about 1648 in Enon. After Wenham had a church, Richard was rec
1 CONC eived by letter from Salem on Aug. 4, 1649. 
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1651, having sold his house and land in Wenham to Samuel FORESTER, Rich
1 CONC ard bought a tract of land in the plantation of Newbury, about 15 miles no
1 CONC rth of Wenham, on the High Road, near “The Upper Green”. The town gave h
1 CONC im 14 acres of marsh in 1651 in exchange for a right-of-way on Ocean Aven
1 CONC ue or Rolfe’s Lane. Later the town committee to settle a land dispute wi
1 CONC th John EMERY granted him an island in Plum Island River near Sandy Beac
1 CONC h. He was chosen as a trial juryman in 1654 and 1671 and a grand jurym
1 CONC an in 1658, 1665, and 1672. He took the Oath of Allegiance in 1678. 
1 CONT
1 CONT In King Philips War Richard supplied for the troops cheese, a pair of band
1 CONC oleers, bullets, a pound of powder and a worm, a horse for 20 weeks, a kna
1 CONC psack, and a saddle and bridle. He asked 5 shillings for curing a hor
1 CONC se as well. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Richard PETTINGELL did not make a will but divided his houses and lands be
1 CONC tween his three sons by deeds. On July 15, 1695, he granted to his son Mat
1 CONC thew the two acres on which he lived, several other small acreages and one
1 CONC -third interest in the third of the farm of 70 acres in Salem which his fa
1 CONC ther-in-law, Richard INGERSOLL, had conditionally willed to him. Two da
1 CONC ys later, on July 17, he granted to his son Samuel the upland where Samu
1 CONC el dwelt and other small lots, but the one third of one third of the INGER
1 CONC SOLL farm was to go to Samuel’s son Samuel. On the same day his own homest
1 CONC ead of five acres and other small lots went to his youngest son Nathani
1 CONC el together with a third of a third of the INGERSOLL farm in Salem. He di
1 CONC ed soon afterwards.

1 CONT Mather's "Magnolia" 
1 CONT
1 CONT "Mr. James Noyes was born in 1608, in Choulderton, Wiltshire, of Godly par
1 CONC ents. His father was a Minister of the same town - a very learned man, - t
1 CONC he school-master of Mr. Robert Parker, and he had much of his education a
1 CONC nd tutorage under Mr. Thomas Parker. 
1 CONT
1 CONT He was called by him from Brazen Nose College in Oxford, to help him in te
1 CONC aching the Free School at Newbury, where they taught school together til t
1 CONC he time they came to New England. 
1 CONT
1 CONT He was converted in his youth by the ministry of Dr. Twiss and Mr. Thom
1 CONC as Parker, and was admired for his piety, and his virtue in his younger ye
1 CONC ars. The reason of his coming to New England was because he could not comp
1 CONC ly with the ceremonies of the Church of England. 
1 CONT
1 CONT He was married in England to Miss Sarah Brown, of South Hampton, not lo
1 CONC ng before he came to New England, which was in 1634. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Noyes-Gilman: "Soon after being called to teach in the Free School at Newb
1 CONC ury, England, Sir Richard Saltonstall, Henry Sewall, Richard and Stephen D
1 CONC rummer and others were organizing a colony for the purpose of stock-raisi
1 CONC ng in New England, and they interested in their enterprise many Wiltshi
1 CONC re men. These, with Rev. Thomas Parker as their spiritual guide and teache
1 CONC r, became the nucleus of the colony, and through their cousin, both Jame
1 CONC s, then but twenty-five, and his younger brother Nicholas joined the colon
1 CONC y. James married Sarah Brown before emigrating. 
1 CONT
1 CONT In the same ship came Mr. Thomas Parker, Mr. James Noyes, and a younger br
1 CONC other, Nicholas Noyes, who was then a single man; Mr. Parker and Mr. Noye
1 CONC s, and others that came over with them, fasted and prayed together many ti
1 CONC mes before they undertook this voyage; and on the sea Mr. Parker and Mr. N
1 CONC oyes preached or expounded, one in the forenoon, and the other in the afte
1 CONC rnoon, every day during the voyage, unless some extraordinary thing interv
1 CONC ened; and were abundant in prayer. 
1 CONT
1 CONT When they arrived, Mr. Parker was first called to preach at Ipswich, and M
1 CONC r. Noyes at Mistick, at which places they continued nigh a year. He h
1 CONC ad a motion made unto him to be minister at Watertown; but Mr. Parker a
1 CONC nd others of his acquaintance, settling at Newbury, and gathering a ten
1 CONC th of the churches in the colony, and calling Mr. Noyes to be teacher of i
1 CONC t, he preferred that place, being loth to be separated from Mr. Parker a
1 CONC nd brethren that had so often fasted and prayed togetheer, both in Engla
1 CONC nd and on the Atlantic sea. So he became the teacher of that church, and c
1 CONC ontinued, painful and successful in that station something above twenty ye
1 CONC ars, without any considerable trouble in the church. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Notwithstanding his principles, as to Dicipline were something differing f
1 CONC rom many of his brethren, there was such condescension on both parts, th
1 CONC at peace and order were not interrupted. 
1 CONT
1 CONT He was much loved and honored in Newbury, - his memory is precious the
1 CONC re to this day, and his Catachism (which is a publick and standing testimo
1 CONC ny of his understanding, and orthodoxy in the principles of religion
1 CONC ), is publicly and privately used in that town hitherto. He was very learn
1 CONC ed in the Tongues, and in the Greek, excelled most. He was much read in t
1 CONC he Fathers and the Schoolmen, and much esteemed in the Ministry. 
1 CONT
1 CONT His conversation was so unquestionably Godly, that they who differed fr
1 CONC om him in the smaller matters as to discipline, held a most amicable corre
1 CONC spondence with him, and had an high estimate of him. *** He was as religio
1 CONC us at home as abroad, in his family and in secret, as he was publickly; a
1 CONC nd they that best knew him, most loved and esteemed him. *** He had a lo
1 CONC ng and tedious sickness, which he bore patiently and cheerfully; and he di
1 CONC ed joyfully, in the forty-eighth year of his age, Oct. 22, 1656. He left s
1 CONC ix sons and two daughters, all of which lived to be married and have child
1 CONC ren, though since one son and one dughter be dead. He hath now living, fif
1 CONC ty-six children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren; and his brother t
1 CONC hat came over with him a single man, is, through the mercy of God, yet liv

1 CONT Mr. James Noyes was born, 1608, at Choulderton in Wiltshire, of godly a
1 CONC nd worthy parents. His father was minister of the same town, a very learn
1 CONC ed man, the school-master of Mr. Thomas Parker. His mother was sister to t
1 CONC he learned Mr. Robert Parker, and he had much of his education and tutora
1 CONC ge under Mr. Thomas Parker. He was called by him from Brazen-Nose-Colle
1 CONC ge in Oxford, to help him in teaching the free school at Newberry; where t
1 CONC hey taught school together till the time they came to New-England. He w
1 CONC as converted in his youth by the ministry of Dr. Twiss and Mr. Thomas Park
1 CONC er, and was admired for his piety and his virtue in his younger years. T
1 CONC he reason of his coming to New-England was, because he could not comply wi
1 CONC th the ceremonies of the Church of England. He was married in England to M
1 CONC rs. Sarah Brown, the eldest daughter of Mr. Joseph Brown, of Southampto
1 CONC n, not long before he came to New-England, which was in the year 163
1 CONC 4. In the same ship [in 1634] came Mr. Thomas Parker, Mr. James Noyes, a
1 CONC nd a younger brother of his, Mr. Nicholas Noyes, who was then a single ma
1 CONC n; between which there was more than ordinary endearment of affection, whi
1 CONC ch was never shaken or broken but by death. Mr. Parker and Mr. James Noye
1 CONC s, and others that came over with them, fasted and prayed together many ti
1 CONC mes before they undertook this voyage; and on the sea Mr. Parker and Mr. N
1 CONC oyes preached or expounded, one in the forenoon. the other in the afternoo
1 CONC n, every day during the voyage. unless some extraordinary thing intervene
1 CONC d, and were abundant in prayer.
1 CONT
1 CONT When they arrived, Mr. Parker was at first called to preach at Ipswich, a
1 CONC nd Mr. Noyes at Medford, at which places they continued nigh a year. He h
1 CONC ad a motion made unto him to be minister at Watertown; but Mr. Parker a
1 CONC nd others of his brethren and acquaintance, settling at Newberry, and gath
1 CONC ering the tenth of the churches in the colony, and calling Mr. Noy
1 CONC es to be the teacher of it, he preferred that place; being loath to be sep
1 CONC arated from Mr. Parker, and brethren that had so often fasted and prayed t
1 CONC ogether, both in England and on the Atlantic sea. So he became the teach
1 CONC er of that church, and continued painful and successful in that station so
1 CONC mething above twenty years, without any considerable trouble in the churc
1 CONC h. Notwithstanding his principles, as to discipline, were something differ
1 CONC ing from many of the brethren, there was such condescension on both part
1 CONC s, that peace and order was not interrupted [Magnalia 484-85].
1 CONT
1 CONT The final sentence refers to the presbyterian inclinations of James Noy
1 CONC es and his cousin THOMAS PARKER {1634, Ipswich}. As will be seen by refere
1 CONC nce to the sketch of the latter, had James Noyes lived for another fifte
1 CONC en years he would have seen the dissolution of peace and order.
1 CONT
1 CONT On 4 November 1645, “Mr. John Coggswell” sued “Mr. Jeames Noyce”; the cau
1 CONC se for the lawsuit and the outcome were not stated [EQC 1:87]. On 24 Septe
1 CONC mber 1650, “Mr. Jeames Noyce” sued “John Tillison for killing a mare; verd
1 CONC ict for plaintiff, £27 and the colt” [EQC 1:199].
1 CONT
1 CONT The dates of birth for Thomas Noyes and John Noyes as given in the publish
1 CONC ed Newbury vital records are less than ten months apart. Examinati
1 CONC on of a microfilm copy of the original first volume of Newbury town recor
1 CONC ds shows that these are the dates entered at the time of the births. Howev
1 CONC er, there are some discrepancies. Many pages of this volume are worn, a
1 CONC nd not easy to read. The entry dated 10 August 1648 seems to have original
1 CONC ly had some other given name, with Thomas overwritten contemporaneous
1 CONC ly in the same or a similar hand. The entry dated 4 June 1649 originally h
1 CONC ad Thomas as the given name, with John written above Thomas in the same ha
1 CONC nd. These two entries certainly pertain to the sons Thomas and John, b
1 CONC ut it is not certain which name should be connected with which date.
1 CONT
1 CONT Note also that there is a gap of nearly five years after the birth of Mos
1 CONC es with no other child recorded for James Noyes. On the other hand, the g
1 CONC ap between the entry dated 4 June 1649 and the next child, Rebecca, bo
1 CONC rn on 1 April 1651, is close to the standard two years. This suggests th
1 CONC at the child recorded as born on 10 August 1648 might actually have been b
1 CONC orn a year or two earlier.
1 CONT

1 CONT
1 CONT BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE: Cotton Mather published a biographical sketch of th
1 CONC is immigrant, composed by his nephew Nicholas Noyes [Magnalia 483-86
1 CONC ]. In 1904 Col. Henry E. Noyes and Miss Harriete E. Noyes compiled a genea
1 CONC logy of this family [Genealogical Record of Some of the Noyes Descendan
1 CONC ts of James, Nicholas and Peter Noyes, Volume II, “Descendants of James a
1 CONC nd Peter Noyes” (Boston 1904)]. In 1907 Charles Phelps Noyes published a c
1 CONC omprehensive treatment of this family [Noyes-Gilman 9-16]. In 1995 Dean Cr
1 CONC awford Smith and Paul C. Reed presented four generations of the agnate anc
1 CONC estry of James Noyes [NEHGR 149:105-21].

1 CONC In her will, Anne NOYES names only the youngest NOYES children, includi
1 CONC ng James and Nicholas. This "division of interests" suggests that Willi
1 CONC am may have had an earlier wife who was mother of the older boys who we
1 CONC re born ca. 1596-1600. Although Anne PARKER was of a suitable age to ha
1 CONC ve been mother to all the known children, Ann STEPHENS, could possibly ha
1 CONC ve been the first wife as suggested in a newspaper clipping attached to o
1 CONC ne of the New England Historical and Genealogical Society lending libra
1 CONC ry Noyes Genealogy books. It would be interesting to pursue this possibili
1 CONC ty since the newspaper clipping update speaks only to updated "proof" th
1 CONC at Ann STEPHENS was wife to William NOYES as opposed to specifically sayi
1 CONC ng she was mother to James and Nicholas. Neither is there source materi
1 CONC al included in the article. 
1 CONT Additionally "Ould Newbury" says "Rev. William Noyes married Anne Stephen
1 CONC s, daughter of Nicholas Stephens, Esq. of Burdop Manor, in Wiltshire, Engl
1 CONC and. Again, there is no reference saying that Ann Stephens was the moth
1 CONC er of the younger children including James and Nicholas, only that their f
1 CONC ather, William, had married Anne Stephens, thus establishing a familial co
1 CONC nnection with the Rev. Thomas Parker who married Anne Stephens' sister Dor
1 CONC othy. 
1 CONT It is curious that Ann named only the youngest Noyes children in her wil
1 CONC l, while eldest child Ephraim named only his brother John and the childr
1 CONC en of deceased brother Nathan. Widows had much more latitude in choosing l
1 CONC egatees than their husbands did, yet it is unusual that Ann bothered to ma
1 CONC ke token bequests to children in New England while ignoring children relat
1 CONC ively nearby. This division of interests suggests that Ann may have been m
1 CONC other of the youngest children and that William had an earlier wife who w
1 CONC as mother of the older boys. Despite Walter Goodwin Davis' "The Ancest
1 CONC ry of Abel Lunt" (Portland, Me., 1963), pp.71-78 willingness to accept mul
1 CONC tiple wives for Rev. William, no other evidence supports this interpretati
1 CONC on, and Ann was of a suitable age to have been mother to all the known chi
1 CONC ldren. 
1 CONT Rev. Cotton MATHER, pastor of the North Church in Boston, wrote to Rev. N
1 CONC icholas NOYES of Salem requesting more information on Rev. Thomas PARK
1 CONC ER of Newbury. Rev. NOYES was a grandson of Rev. William NOYES of Choldert
1 CONC on, by Rev. James NOYES. Rev. N. NOYES replied to Rev. MATHER with the fol
1 CONC lowing information: "Mr. James NOYES was born, 1608, at Cholderton in Wilt
1 CONC shire, of godly and worthy parents. His father [Rev. William] was minist
1 CONC er of that same town, a very learned man, the school master of Mr. Thom
1 CONC as PARKER. His mother was sister to the learned Mr. Robert PARKER, a
1 CONC nd he [James] had much of his education and tutorage under Mr. Thomas PARK
1 CONC ER." This contemporary reference by a grandson would seem to support the c
1 CONC ontention that the mother of James and Nicholas was indeed Anne PARK
1 CONC ER as opposed to Ann STEPHENS. 
1 CONT Savage also notes that "This s. [Thomas PARKER] serv. short time at the a
1 CONC ltar in Newbury, Eng. and came in the Mary and John, May 1634, with his ne
1 CONC ph. Rev. James Noyes, ...." This reference to Rev. James NOYES as the neph
1 CONC ew of Thomas PARKER also is supportive of the Anne PARKER theory. 
1 CONT She was buried at Choulderton 7 Mar 1657, aged eighty-two years (Parish R
1 CONC egister). 
1 CONT "Massachusetts & Maine Families in the Ancestry of Walter Goodwin Davis
1 CONC ", Vol III p 54 states "His [William Noyes] certain wife was Anne Parker w
1 CONC hom he married before 1608

1 CONC nd Indexes, No. 50, "List of Early Chancery Proceedings", vol.7 (London, 1
1 CONC 926), p.186) Joan Noyes left the earliest Noyes will on record. Buried out
1 CONC side the door of the church of Blessed Mary of Kimpton next to wife Joa
1 CONC n. excepting the advowson of Wee [Weyhill] Church, for a period of 50 yea
1 CONC rs at a rent of £8 6s 8d. Another lease, dated 21 June 10 Henry VIII [151
1 CONC 8] granted the same, at the same rate, for a period of 40 years. Thomas No
1 CONC yse was farmer of the manor on 6 October 20 Henry VIII [1528] when he ma
1 CONC de agreements with his tenants This last Thomas Noyes is certainly Thom
1 CONC as Noyes (b. say 1488), from whom descent can be traced with certainty. 
1 CONT There are two likely scenarios by which Ramridge might have descended thr
1 CONC ough the earliest generations of the Hampshire Noyes family. The first sce
1 CONC nario assumes a direct descent through [1] Robert (b. say 1390), [II] Jo
1 CONC hn (b. say 1415), [III] Robert (b. say 1440), [IV] Thomas of Andover (b. s
1 CONC ay 1465), to [V] Thomas (b. say 1488). 
1 CONT The second scenario takes into account the possibility that the Robert w
1 CONC ho farmed Ramridge from 1493 to 1497 might have been Thomas's uncle Rober
1 CONC t, who later acquired the lease of the manor of Littleton, and may have he
1 CONC ld Ramridge during the minority of his nephew Thomas as guardian. The earl
1 CONC iest [I] Robert (b. say 1390) who farmed Ramridge in 1432-33 would aga
1 CONC in be the first generation, then the second generation would be unknown. [
1 CONC III] John (b. say 1440) who farmed Ramridge from 1475 to 1484 would be nex
1 CONC t, and father of both [IV] Thomas (b. say 1465) mentioned in the court rol
1 CONC ls of Andover 1490-1491, and Robert, of Kimpton, who farmed Ramridge fr
1 CONC om 1493 to 1497 during the minority of his nephew, [V] Thomas Noyes (b. s
1 CONC ay 1488). 
1 CONT But as only names and dates have been gleaned from the manorial record
1 CONC s, no specific relationships are known with certainty until we reach Thom
1 CONC as Noyes (b. say 1488). It is impossible at this point to determine whi
1 CONC ch descent is correct.

1 CONC Thomas Birkbeck, from 'Prominent People' in 1880:
1 CONT Thomas Birkbeck, of Upper Lehigh, was born in Foster township, June 1st, 1
1 CONC 846, and married Miss Margaret Snedden, of Audenreid, Pa. He is a butch
1 CONC er and a dealer in real estate. He enlisted July 11th, 1864, in Compa
1 CONC ny G. 179th Pennsylvania volunteers, and was discharged after one hundr
1 CONC ed days.
1 CONT --------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 CONC --------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 CONC ------------------
1 CONT The life and history of Thomas Birkbeck are very closely connected with t
1 CONC he historical development of the town of Freeland and vicinity. He is a s
1 CONC on of Joseph and Elizabeth (Johnstone) Birkbeck, the former born in Westmo
1 CONC reland, England, May 2, 1802, the latter being also a native of England, b
1 CONC orn February 12, 1804, at Buck Hill, Stainmoor; they were married in 182
1 CONC 6, at Brough's Church, England. In 1834 they landed in New York City, when
1 CONC ce they immediately proceeded to Minersville, Schuylkill county, this Stat
1 CONC e(PA), where Mr. Birkbeck secured employment in the mines. After remaini
1 CONC ng there about two years, they came to Hazleton, where in 1838 he sunk t
1 CONC he first slope for Ario Pardee. In 1840 he bought of Edward Lynch a tra
1 CONC ct of four hundred acres of land in Denison township, which later became p
1 CONC art of Foster township and is now the site of Freeland borough. There he c
1 CONC onstructed a rude log-house. He then returned with his family to his new p
1 CONC urchase, a vast and uncultivated wilderness, which possessed all the chara
1 CONC cteristics of a pioneer farm. This house was the only one within a radi
1 CONC us of five miles, with the single exception of that of Korcher, which w
1 CONC as situated two miles to the northeast. Here the family spent their winte
1 CONC rs in lumbering, manufacturing handmade shingles, and cutting down and cle
1 CONC aring the forest, and in summer time they cultivated the small patch
1 CONC es of land thus cleared. The shingles were carted to Conyngham, and the
1 CONC re exchanged for the necessaries of life, as at this time no cash was pa
1 CONC id in such transactions. In 1844 Mr. Birbeck sold fifty acres from his fou
1 CONC r-hundred-acre lot, in time converted the dense forests into fertile farmi
1 CONC ng land.  A short time afterward the coal fields were developed in the nei
1 CONC ghborhood, and the great influx of population necessitated a new arrangeme
1 CONC nt. Mr. Birkbeck accordingly surveyed a large portion of his real estate p
1 CONC ossessions into town lots, and sold them to the newcomers. This constitut
1 CONC ed the first move in the laying out of South Heberton and Freeland. Mr. Bi
1 CONC rkbeck was a man well-versed in the anthracite coal strata in this localit
1 CONC y, and was the first to prove coal at Highland and Upper Lehigh. He bui
1 CONC lt many roads, and was at all times the leading character in the developme
1 CONC nt of the new country. The family experienced all the trials of a pione
1 CONC er life which the novelist describes. A story is told of how, during o
1 CONC ne of those early days in the wilderness, Mrs. Birkbeck killed a full-gro
1 CONC wn buck deer, with no weapon but an axe. In the Birkbeck family there we
1 CONC re twelve children, viz.: John, born September 5, 1827, died in infancy; J
1 CONC oseph N., born July 28, 1829, now residing in Wilkes-Barre; 1827, Matthe
1 CONC w, born June 28, 1829 (deceased); Jane, born October 31, 1832 (deceased
1 CONC ); John (second), born April 26, 1834 (deceased); Matthew (second), born J
1 CONC anuary 7m 1836 (deceased); Jane, born October 6, 1836, wife of William Joh
1 CONC nston, of Freeland, PA.; Betsey, born May 14, 1840 (deceased), and Anna Vi
1 CONC ctoria, born May 12, 1850 (deceased). Joseph Birkbeck died April 19, 187
1 CONC 2, Mrs. Birkbeck surviving until May 31, 1887. Thomas Birkbeck was bo
1 CONC rn in the old log house, which was situated about four blocks northwe
1 CONC st of his present handsome and cosy residence. During his early boyhood da
1 CONC ys he attended school at Eckley, during the winter months, and worked at h
1 CONC ome in the summer. When he was about ten years of age the coal mines we
1 CONC re opened at Eckley, and there he engaged in picking slate at twenty-fi
1 CONC ve cents per day. In 1859 he left the mines and entered the employ of Fra
1 CONC nk Person, a drover (someone who drives a herd) of Troy, PA., and worked f
1 CONC or him, driving cattle, for two years. He then worked with his brother, w
1 CONC ho was a butcher at Eckley. Here he learned the trade and remained until J
1 CONC une, 1863, when he enlisted in Company G, One Hundred and Ninetyseventh Pe
1 CONC nnsylvania Volunteers, serving until the close of the war. After his retu
1 CONC rn home Mr. Birkbeck worked at blacksmithing a short time at Foundryvill
1 CONC e, when he went to Auderied and worked as a butcher for Herman Hamburge
1 CONC r. In 1866 he engaged in the butchering business for himself, at South Heb
1 CONC erton, where he remained one year, when he removed his business to Upper L
1 CONC ehigh, following it there just twenty-one years. In 1886 he removed to Fre
1 CONC eland; followed droving a short time, and then engaged in the hardware bus
1 CONC iness, which he still continues. He is also largely interested in real est
1 CONC ate in the locality, owning over forty properties in this section. He is a
1 CONC lso interested in several cottages at the celebrated summer resort, at Wil
1 CONC dwood, N.J. He was one of the promoters of the Citizens Bank of Freelan
1 CONC d, also of the Freeland Water Works, being at present a heavy stockhold
1 CONC er in both these institutions; he is also interested in many local enterpr
1 CONC ises. Mr. Birkbeck was married November 1, 1866, to Miss Margaret Sneddo
1 CONC n, of Audenried. They have seven children, viz.: Joseph, William, Thoma
1 CONC s, Lillie May, Jessie, Margaret and Daisy.

1 CONT  One of the best public institutions of Freeland being the water work

1 CONT incorporated July 20, 1883, the incorporators being the following official
1 CONC s: 
1 CONT President, Joseph Birkbeck; treasurer, Thomas Birkbeck; secretary, F. Schi
1 CONC lcher. 
1 CONT The works were commenced and completed in 1883, and the water was turn
1 CONC ed on in 
1 CONT November of that year. The main supply is from two artesian wells, o
1 CONC ne on the 
1 CONT east of town and one on the north. These furnish the finest granite-wate
1 CONC r, cool, 
1 CONT and the freest from animal matter of any attainable waters. From the engin
1 CONC es the 
1 CONT water is pumped to the top of the hill west of town, where is one of the f
1 CONC inest 
1 CONT arranged reservoirs in the State, all under roof, and the building surroun
1 CONC ded by 
1 CONT a ten-foot fence quite a distance from the building, making it impossib
1 CONC le for 
1 CONT anything to be put in the reservoir from the outside. This water in the lo

1 CONT sufficient for a population, in any emergency, of 50,000. The elegan
1 CONC ce of the 
1 CONT Freeland water is another great inducement added to the place for maki

1 CONT In 1842 Joseph Birkbeck purchased a part of the land on which the borou

1 CONT and immediately commenced to improve his farm, building his residence a sh
1 CONC ort 
1 CONT distance north of what is now the north borough line. The Birkbeck esta

1 CONT owns the farm land joining the north borough limits. About the same time A
1 CONC aron 
1 CONT Howe (or Howey), commenced to open his farm to the west of Birkbeck, and t
1 CONC he 
1 CONT most of the town is built upon a part of his tract. These two then, were t
1 CONC he 
1 CONT pioneer settlers in this part of Foster township. They built their hous
1 CONC es on the 
1 CONT side of the hill and cleared and farmed the land along the hillside down i
1 CONC nto 
1 CONT the valley. The first settler within the borough limits was William Johnso
1 CONC n, 
1 CONT laborer; then Thomas Morgan, a blacksmith from Jeddo; he sold to Patrick 
1 CONT McGlynn; then came James Williamson, from Eckley, whose family still resi
1 CONC de in 
1 CONT the place. The first store was opened by Joseph Lindsey in 1875; th
1 CONC en H. C. 
1 CONT Koons started his place of business. Lindsey's store was on what is now t
1 CONC he 
1 CONT corner of Pine and Walnut streets, and Koons' was on the corner of Front a
1 CONC nd 
1 CONT Center streets. The next store was that of Thomas Campbell, who is still o

1 CONT the leading business men of [p.564] the place. The first schoolhouse was p
1 CONC ut up 
1 CONT in 1868, and in time, where it stood was mined under and a squeeze threate

1 CONT Thomas Johnson Birkbeck, one of the pioneer settlers of Freeland, Luzer

1 CONC nd successful real estate dealter, was born June 6, 1845, son of Joseph a
1 CONC nd Elizabeth (Johnson) Birkbeck.
1 CONT Thomas J. Birkbeck obtained his educational training at Echley, attendi
1 CONC ng school during the winter months and assisting with the farm work duri
1 CONC ng the summer. The coal mines were opened at Echley when Thomas J. was abo
1 CONC ut ten years of age, and there he entered upon his first regular employmen
1 CONC t, that of picking slate at a salary of twenty-five cents per day. He le
1 CONC ft the mines in 1859 and entered the employ of Frank Person, a drove
1 CONC r, of Troy, Pennsylvania, and for two years worked at driving cattle. At t
1 CONC he expiration of this period of time he became associated with his brothe
1 CONC r, who was then following his trade of butcher in Eckley, and for the foll
1 CONC owing two years was engaged in learning the butcher business. In June 18
1 CONC 63 when the great Civil War was in progress, Mr. Birkbeck responded to t
1 CONC he urgent call for volunteers, enlisting in Company G One Hundred and Nine
1 CONC ty-Seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers and serving until the cesstation of hos
1 CONC tilities. After his return to civil life he was occupied in the blacksmith
1 CONC ing business for a short time in Foundryville, from whence he removed to A
1 CONC ndenried, where he found employment in the butcher establishment of Herm
1 CONC an Hamburger. He embarked in the butcher business on his own account at So
1 CONC uth Heberton in 1866 and the following year removed his business to Upp
1 CONC er Lehigh, where he successfully conducted the same for the long peri
1 CONC od of twenty-one years. He removed to Freeland in 1886, and for a short pe
1 CONC riod of time was engaged in droving after which he turned his attenti
1 CONC on to the hardware business which he has continued up to the present ti
1 CONC me (1905) and in which he is eminently successful.
1 CONT Mr. Birkbeck was one of the promoters of the Freeland water works and t
1 CONC he Citizens' Bank of Freeland, in both of which institutions he is a hea
1 CONC vy stockholder. In addition to these varied business enterprises Mr. Birkb
1 CONC eck is interested in real estate being the owner of over forty valuable pr
1 CONC operties in his section and having a personal interest in several cottag
1 CONC es at the celebrated summer resort Wildwood, NJ. Mr. Birkbeck is pre-emine
1 CONC ntly a self-made man. Beginning life in a very humble way, with no capit
1 CONC al except those success-bringing qualities-honesty, industry and persevera
1 CONC nce-he has reached an enviable place in the business world and accumulat
1 CONC ed for himself and family a handsome competency.

1 CONC er Lehigh, and what was mostly South Heberton is now known as Upper Lehig
1 CONC h. It was platted in 1865. There were over 200 miners homes there. In 18
1 CONC 67 a postoffice was established and the mail came from Eckley. The compa
1 CONC ny store was opened in 1866. The Upper Lehigh hotel was opened for gues

1 CONT The Wyoming & Lackawanna Valleys, con't pg 554:
1 CONT Joseph Birkbeck was a native of Westmoreland, England, born May 2, 180
1 CONC 2. He married Elizabeth Johnson, born at Buck Hill, Stainmoor, England, Fe
1 CONC bruary 12, 1804; the marriage was celebrated at Broough's Church, Englan
1 CONC d, in 1826. They emigrated to the United States, landing in New York Ci
1 CONC ty in 1834, whence they immediately proceeded to Minersville, Schuylkill C
1 CONC o., PA. After about two years residence in this place, during which time M
1 CONC r. Birkbeck was employed in the mines, they removed to Hazleton, whe
1 CONC re he sunk the first slope in 1838 for Ario Pardee. Two years later he pur
1 CONC chased a tract of land comprising four hundred acres in Denison township f
1 CONC rom Edward Lynch, which later became Foster township and is now the si
1 CONC te of Freeland borough. He constructed a rude log house on this land, in
1 CONC to which he and his family removed. The surrounding country was a vast unc
1 CONC ultivated wilderness, and Mr. Birkbeck's purchase possessed all the charac
1 CONC teristics of a poineer farm. During the winters the family spent their ti
1 CONC me in lumbering, clearing the forest, and manufacturing handmade shingle
1 CONC s, which were carried to Conyngham, where they were exchanged for the nece
1 CONC ssaries of life, no cash being paid for such transactions at that tim
1 CONC e. In 1844 Mr. Birkbeck sold fifty acres of his land to Aaron Howey, who w
1 CONC as closely followed by many other settlers, but not until 1866 was the den
1 CONC se forests converted into excellent farming land. Not long after this co
1 CONC al fields were developed in the neighborhood, and new arrangements beca
1 CONC me a necessity owing to the rapidly increasing population, Mr. Birkbeck su
1 CONC rveyed his land, converted it into town lots, which he sold to the newcome
1 CONC rs, thus making the first move in laying out the towns of South Heberton a
1 CONC nd Freeland. Joseph Birkbeck was the first to prove coal at Highland and U
1 CONC pper Lehigh, being well versed in the anthracite coal strata in the vicini
1 CONC ty. He was the builder of many roads, and was preeminently the leading fig
1 CONC ure in the development of the new country. He and his family were subject
1 CONC ed to all the trials, hardships and vicissitudes incident to a pioneer lif
1 CONC e, and a story is told of how Mrs. Birkbeck, during one of those early, tr
1 CONC ying days, with no other weapon than an axe, killed a full grown buck deer

1 CONT Description of Andersonville Prison:
1 CONT By the winter of 1863-64 the Confederacy was near the last of its resourc
1 CONC es and manpower. Knowing this, Union General Ulysses S. Grant refused to c
1 CONC ontinue the prisoner-exchange agreement that had been in operation duri
1 CONC ng most of the war. This action cut down on the number of Confederate sold
1 CONC iers Grant's army would have to face in the coming campaign, but it also m
1 CONC eant death to a great number of Union prisoners who would otherwise have b
1 CONC een exchanged.
1 CONT
1 CONT The concentration of war prisoners in Richmond, Va., drained the local fo
1 CONC od supply and was a source of danger should the Yankees attack. To relie
1 CONC ve the burden, a new prison site was selected in the heart of Georgia, ne
1 CONC ar the village of Andersonville in Sumter County. The prison was official
1 CONC ly named Camp Sumter. When the first prisoners arrived in late February 18
1 CONC 64, they found 16.5 acres of open land enclosed by a 15 foot tall stockad
1 CONC e. The not yet completed prison provided little in the way of housing, clo
1 CONC thing, or medical care. The only fresh water was a stream that flowed thro
1 CONC ugh the prison yard, with the downstream end serving as the camp latrin
1 CONC e. During the next few months, 400 more prisoners arrived each day, a
1 CONC nd in June the prison was expanded to 26 acres. By then there were 26,0
1 CONC 00 men enclosed in an area intended to hold 10,000. By August the prison c
1 CONC ontained more than 32,000 Union prisoners.
1 CONT
1 CONT Conditions at Andersonville were worse than at any other war prison, Nor
1 CONC th or South. The Georgia heat, along with disease, filth, exposure, and la
1 CONC ck of adequate medical care, took a fearfull toll. In September 1864, Gene
1 CONC ral William T. Sherman's Union army captured Atlanta and brought its caval
1 CONC ry within reach of Andersonville. The confederacy relocated surviving pris
1 CONC oners to other camps, and Camp Sumter operated as a smaller facility for t
1 CONC he rest of the war. But the summer had taken a terrible toll: of the 45,0
1 CONC 00 Union soldiers confined at Camp Sumter, 13,000 died.

1 CONT Andersonville Prison
1 CONT
1 CONT Union prisoners were encamped at Andersonville Prison, or Camp Sumte
1 CONC r, in southwest Georgia. By 1864 Andersonville held the largest prison pop
1 CONC ulation of the Civil War, and prisoners suffered from starvation and disea
1 CONC se as a result of severe overcrowding. 
1 CONT The most notorious camp was run by the Confederates in Andersonville, G
1 CONC a. More than 45,000 Union soldiers were imprisoned there during little mo
1 CONC re than a year of the war. Almost 13,000 died from gangrene, dysentery a
1 CONC nd diarrhea. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Soldier Hugh Moore's testimony of the horror of being in the Andersonvil
1 CONC le Prison:
1 CONT On the 25th day of July, 1864, in company with 1700 other prisoners of wa
1 CONC r, I entered Andersonville. I shall never forget that day. The older priso
1 CONC ners, or they who had been held the longest, were worn down with want, sic
1 CONC kness, and famine, with shrunken bodies, disheveled hair, eyes deep s
1 CONC et in their sockets, fingers long and bony, and emaciated looks. Turn whi
1 CONC ch way you would, you were met with suffering and sorrow, while the air w
1 CONC as impregnated with sickening odors of rank corruption and loathsome death
1 CONC ....
1 CONT Our rations in July and a part of August, was a piece of corn bread, abo
1 CONC ut four inches square, and two inches thick: after this it was a pint of m
1 CONC eal each day. For cooking vessels we used our tin cup and cast-away fru
1 CONC it cans, such as we could beg or buy from the guards. For shelter, t
1 CONC wo of us joined and put our blankets together, one on the ground to l
1 CONC ie or sit on, the other over us to keep off the scorching rays of the s
1 CONC un by day, and the poisonous dews by night. Under this blanket we sat a
1 CONC nd talked of what we would get to eat when we arrived home....
1 CONT Winter was now coming on and my wardrobe was wearing very scant. My shi
1 CONC rt was entirely worn out; my old blouse worn thin, hung on my body in tatt
1 CONC ers. My pants were worn out when I was taken prisoner, but I had worn th
1 CONC em ever since. The last button was gone from them and they hung on me by m
1 CONC eans of small, wooden pegs, similar to shoe pegs, and I was barefoote
1 CONC d. We were divided into hundreds and thousands. 
1 CONT This letter goes on for several paragraphs including his entire duty. He d
1 CONC id live to go home to his family unlike so many others.
